       <h2 style="font-family: Edu AU VIC WA NT Hand, cursive;"> Happy Birthday to the love of my life!</h2>

        From the moment I first saw you on the school balcony, I knew there was something magical about us. Those days feel like a dream now, but I remember how handsome you looked. Over these four incredible years, you’ve shown me what true loyalty and love mean. Yes, we’ve had our fights, but they only make our bond stronger and remind me how much I trust and care for you.
        
        You are everything to me—my happiness, my confidant, my partner in every sense. Your hard work and skill never cease to amaze me, and I pray for your safety and success every day. I’m sorry for the hurtful words I’ve said during our arguments; know that they don’t reflect how deeply I love and cherish you.
        
        Even though I didn’t wish you first today, my love for you is unwavering. I can’t imagine my life without you. The rainy days we’ve spent together and the countless moments we’ve shared are etched in my heart. From school days to now, every memory with you is precious and filled with joy.
        
        Here’s to many more years of laughter, love, and unforgettable moments together. I wish for us to stay together forever, growing and loving each other more with each passing day.
        
        Happy Birthday, my love. You mean everything to me.
        
        With all my heart,
